# 1D-HSI Solver

This is the code repository associated with the paper ["On the hot surface ignition of a wall-stagnating spray flame,"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2022.111988) D. Mohaddes and M. Ihme, Combustion & Flame 240 (2022).

It is an unsteady multiphase one-dimensional reacting flow solver employing finite-rate chemistry through Cantera and non-equilibrium spray evaporation models. See the associated paper for modeling details.

See the Wiki pages in this repository for information on how to install and run the code.

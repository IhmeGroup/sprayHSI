# 1D-HSI Solver

This is the code repository associated with the paper "On the hot surface ignition of a wall-impinging fuel spray," D. Mohaddes and M. Ihme.

It is an unsteady multiphase one-dimensional reacting flow solver employing finite-rate chemistry and non-equilibrium spray evaporation models. See the associated paper for modeling details.

See the Wiki pages in this repository for information on how to install and run the code.
